## Notes
```
• This has zero functionality.
• We would like the hover effect to be different for buttons 1-5
• I tried to show what each different option would show in hover/active state.
    - The 1-5 button should highlight with its respective color
    - The faux chat bubble should display a specific message
• 1 = bad, 5 = great
```
